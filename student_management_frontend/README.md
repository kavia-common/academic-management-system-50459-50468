# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify
- **No Authentication**: All pages (Dashboard, Students, Courses, Attendance, Settings) are publicly accessible

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Environment configuration

The app reads URLs and simple settings from environment variables:
- `REACT_APP_API_BASE` (preferred) or `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` for the base API URL
- `REACT_APP_HEALTHCHECK_PATH` for the health check endpoint path (defaults to `/health`)
- `REACT_APP_NODE_ENV` for environment indicator

Endpoints should not be hardcoded; configure via env variables.
